<br>I have got random room generation working but have not yet started on coridors to connect rooms
<br>I think an orthonographic camera needs to be implemented instead of viewing whole room soon too
<br>BTW I'm more or less following this for the random floor generation http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-procedurally-generated-dungeon-cave-system--gamedev-10099
